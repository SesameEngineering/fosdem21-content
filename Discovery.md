The Sesame Discovery is an openly designed chassis that uses
the supply chain from the circular datacenter and is a wonderful
demonstration of what can be done with a completely open ecosystem.

With the Sesame Discovery, you can have a complete IT environment
sitting at home, in a lab, or under your desk at work. The desk
side form factor lends itself to any number of uses outside of
your typical datacenter. In this way, we take all these parts of
hyperscale datacenter components and put them to use in other market segment 
including healthcare, small business, game companies, and start ups.

We can also design for other form factors that conforms
itself to new frontiers - like edge computing, AI, cellular
networks, animation render farms. Let's us unthether ourselves from
rackscale servers and even tradtional datacenters.

As an added bonus, we have already paid the carbon cost of the supply
chain - it means that these sectors get the benefit of low
cost but still powerful compute at a much lower cost than
if buying them new.
