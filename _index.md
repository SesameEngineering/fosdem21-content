description: "Thank you for visiting - <b>Interested in openly designed hardware\
  \ while lowering carbon footprint?</b> You've come to the right place - check out the\ 
  \ open design of the Sesame Discovery chassis\
  \ - allowing individuals, organizations, and companies to have an \"datacenter in\
  \ a box\" in a desk side form factor. With the ability to plug in 4-12 nodes of\
  \ scalable computing - the Sesame Discovery can be used in a variety of projects in any\
  \ location without the need of a data center. <p> From Kubernetes to a Blender render\
  \ farm to medical research, the possibilities are endless. <b>Imagine</b> being able to\
  \ run thousands of containers under 2000 watts?<p>\r\n\r\nVisitors to the stand will\
  \ also learn about the <b><a href=\"https://opencompute.org/\">Open Compute Project</a></b> - a consortium\
  \ of data center companies working in concert to build an open data center without vendor lock-in. The\
  \ Discovery chassis provides an open window how open hardware design works in practice.\
  \ Learn about the role of the circular data center market segment. Not only can\
  \ you have great computational power that you can plug into your home, lab, or\
  \ classroom but the hardware is based on a supply chain of re-certified top tier\
  \ data center components from worlds foremost hyperscale companies like Facebook, Dropbox and Google. By\
  \ leveraging this supply chain we lower our carbon footprint extending\
  \ the life of valuable equipment that already exists rather than manufacturing new ones.\
  \ The circular economy directly relies on open collaboration and open source communities \
  \ for its business.

  \ One important aspect of the circular datacenter is the carbon costs that are saved when using the circular datacenter supply chain. <b>Ali Fenn</b> the President of ITRenew Inc has a great short 12 minute talk about the amount of waste a datacenter can produces as well the amount of resources it consume.\

new_this_year: "The Sesame Discovery project has been in existence for about two years but\
  \ has not had a lot of exposure to the open source and open hardware communities. In that time\
  \ frame, we have modified the chassis to accommodate adding a true 100GBE 32 port white box switch\
  \ This will allow the ability to have even more nodes into chassis but also have\
  \ a true data center networking all within the chassis.\r\n\r\nWe have other active\
  \ designs that are not associated with Discovery but part of a family of open designed\
  \ chassis that we would also be sharing at the booth as well as exciting work with\
  \ partners whose open software projects will be designed to work on our open hardware\
  \ - from edge computing to Kubernetes to AI - come chat with us on what you can do when\ 
  \ you own the supply chain and work with ecosystems can do!"
showcase: "The Sesame Discovery project is a demonstration of what an ecosystem that consists\
  \ of hardware companies, software companies, and the circular economy working in\
  \ concert can do. Combining the collaboration of data center companies, with open\
  \ system design, and open firmware, supplied by a carbon friendly supply chain of\
  \ hardware components - the new data centers we build will be carbon friendly, avoid\
  \ vendor lock-in, whose waste output can be re-purposed to provide heat and energy\
  \ to neighborhoods and finally can scale from a home office or cubicle to the traditional\
  \ computer room.\r\n\r\nCome to our stand to hear about the possibilities that can\
  \ be achieved through juxtaposition of community, openness, and low carbon supply\
  \ chain."
