## What is the circular economy?

Here is a great blog series that engineer, Sriram Ramkrishna wrote up on the circular datacenter and its important to open source.

## The 1 minute read description

The circular datacenter is built upon a supply chain extracted
from first tier datacenter components from top tier hyperscalers
like Google, Dropbox, Facebook, and others. The components are
re-certified and then re-sold to 2nd tier markets.

Long term support of this hardware requires investment in open firmware and BIOS to replace decreasing
ODM support. By moving the equipment to community support we can keep these hardware out of landfills
and continue to be useful for years to come.

By using this supply chain, instead of buying new you reduce the
carbon footprint. The carbon cost of manufacturing silicon and
their components are already paid and the supply chain can be local.

Since the equipment is already in the field it means that the
equipment is many factors cheaper than buying new with an excellent
price per perforamnce.

The circular datacenter business model absolutely depends on open source and open hardware ecosystems leveraging the open data center through projects like the [Open Compute Project](https://opencompute.org/).

Our President, Ali Fenn - has a talk about the carbon savings about the circular datacenter!
