## Sesame Engineering

Sesame Engineering is a division of [ITRenew 
Inc](https://itrenew.com/) that designs, builds, and certifies
hypescale servers in various form factors for different 
markets - on-prem cloud, edge networking, AI and hyperscale servers to
meet demands in education, medical fields, and tech startups and more!

By leveraging ITRenew's circular business model. We can design
new equipment at various form factors to meet the needs of our
customers through open technologies at cheaper price points. 

The Sesame engineering team are committed believers of open collaboration. We
work closely with the ecosystems that help enable us and are always
looking for new partners that will help enable our hardware.

The [Sesame Discovery](/stands/sesame_discovery/discovery/) is our flagship project that
is the basis of our commercial product - Sesame Fast-Start. 

Stop by our chat we would love to meet you all!  :-)

You can also mail us at fosdem@sesame.com - we would be delighted to handle any inquiries.

Open Source/Collaboration Ecosystems that we work with:

[Open Compute Project](https://opencompute.org/) and its various subprojects:

[Open System Firmware](https://www.opencompute.org/projects/open-system-firmware)</br>

[OpenBMC](https://github.com/openbmc)

[SONiC and ONiE](https://www.opencompute.org/projects/sonic)

[Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://https://www.cncf.io//)

[The Linux Foundation](https://linuxfoundation.org/)

Our contributions range from contributing fixes to system firmware,
enabling older platforms, providing hardware for testing frameworks -
or even providing leadership on specific issues. We also write near
metal management software that that all have open licenses.

For Sesame, open collaboration is the most sustainable way to maintain
re-certified hardware for the long term. With the help of community
we can keep silicon away from landfills for longer, find new ways to
re-use hardware, and work with other green companies to help make a
better place for future generations to come.
